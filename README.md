## Redhood

Prototype of a game started at the [Hangover Jam 2017](http://hangoverjam.p1x.in). I added few things (like fog of war) afther the jam. But most of the game and graphics was done in the 1-st of the January.
**Feel free to use the code and made a game of it!**

## Happy LIttle Island

After the Redhood I started to develop a sofisticated pico-8 game engine for RPG like games. 
Also I wanted to push my pixel art skills to the new levels. So this is more like a sandbbox for learning and discovering than a game.
I don't have a clear path what it will be. But slowly the idea starts to grow.

### Engine

- state machine (intro/menu/game/end game)
- fluid camera movement (Zelda like) over the level (2x2 screen size for each level)
- particle generator (static and dynamic)
- entities system with animations
- (todo) entities AI
- (todo) dialog system

### Pixels

- sub-pixel animation for entities
- trees made of 2 sprites and a third combining sprite makeing forests easy and good looking
- pseudo horizon on the top of the map adding depth to the 2D map

### Possible gameplay

- guide rabbits using carrots to their homes on each level
- talk to MPCs to unlock parts of the map

## Experimetns
- dora.p8 is a simple sprite generator with gradiental change
